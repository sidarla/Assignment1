# Project Overview

A modern, fully responsive landing page built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, developed from a provided Figma UI design. The objective of this assignment is to demonstrate strong front-end implementation skills through accurate design translation, layout structuring, responsive behavior, and interactive elements.

This project converts a static Figma layout into a live, pixel-perfect web interface. Every component—typography, spacing, color, and layout—is implemented to closely align with the original design while ensuring accessibility and performance. The page adapts seamlessly across desktops, tablets, and mobile screens.

#Key Features
